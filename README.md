# squint
Blurs your screen 👓

A GPU accelerated program to pixelate or blur your screen, primarily for use
with `i3lock`. Currently only supports X11, but maybe some day I'll look into
Wayland too.

### Storytime
Got fed up with the tiny 3s delay of my `maim + imagemagick` solution on a 4k
screen. Rather than looking for existing solutions, I decided to play around
with X11 and OpenGL. 

# To do
- ~~Pixelate~~
- Blur
- Dynamic configuration    
  (Currently I'm hardcoding things as I develop.)
- More filters! ✨
- Multiple displays! 🖥🖥🖥
  *Currently running a single display so multi-display set ups will need
  testing.*
- `i3lock` replacement with live blurring 🚀    
  *Neat if a bit wasteful.*
- Wayland??? 💻    
  *I don't currently use it (NVidia 🤷️) but perhaps I'll switch to `sway` on my
  laptop.*

# Usage
TO DO: once we can blur the pixels too.
